Hi, My name is Filip, and I'm a teacher at DataCamp. DataCamp is an online Data Science School, and together with Microsoft, we have created the introduction to Python for Data Science course.

Python is a very powerful programming language, that you can use to build practically any software. But you can also use it to do data science. Model your sales data, do text mining on your latest Twitter feeds, or build the next movie recommendation engine: it's all possible with Python. Because Python is free to use, there's a bunch of programmers across the world that have written amazing code that can help you achieve great things.

The best way to learn Python is by doing, and that's why you'll spend most of your time learning in our interactive learning interface. After fun video lessons on edX, you move to our coding environments. There, you'll learn how to use Python to analyze real data, make visualizations, and much more. You get instant and personalized feedback that guides you to the correct solution.

This course is the best way to learn Python specifically for Data Science. No prior background is required. We'll start with the true basics, and then head over to Python lists, functions, and specific packages to do data science: numpy, matplotlib and pandas. Enroll now, and get yourself ready to learn the skill of the future!
