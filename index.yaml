  - type: "VideoExercise"
    title: "First steps into Python"
    content: "A brief history of Python. It's place in data science. The pros and cons of using it in data science. Using the Python console for basic calculations."

  - type: "MultipleChoiceExercise"
    title: "When to use it"
    content: "When to use Python? A few use cases are given. You want to do a quick calculation. You want to build a robust software package. You want to analyse some data. All of the above. "

  - type: "NormalExercise"
    title: "Crunch those numbers"
    content: "You and your friends are splitting the tab. You drank 3 cocktails and 5 beers in total. You want to split the tab evenly. "

    title: "Variables and their types"
    content: "Introducing variables and variable assignment. The difference between types of variables (using strings and booleans)."

  - type: "MultipleChoiceExercise"
    title: "Which is what"
    content: "A list of variables is given with a value. Choose the choice which correctly lists their types."

  - type: "NormalExercise"
    title: "Assign all the variables"
    content: "Instead of remembering the cost of the tab you decide to assign it to a variable for later use. There is one new person whos name you can't seem to remember so you decide to decide his name to a variable as well. Finally you decide to assign a boolean variable to remember the fact whether you were drunk or not."

  - type: "NormalExercise"
    title: "Invalid calculations"
    content: "You find some other variables in your memory of which you have little memory. You decide to check out what their type is. After finding out their type you decide to experiment with them a little bit."

  - type: "MultipleChoiceExercise"
    title: "Which are valid and which aren't"
    content: "You are given a list of variables and operations on them. Select which one will result in an error."

  - type: "NormalExercise"
